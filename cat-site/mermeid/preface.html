    <h1>Preface</h1>
    <p>Francesco Pollini (1762-1846) was an amateur composer, tenor, pianist, and piano teacher who shaped his education
      in Vienna - where he met Wolfgang Amadé Mozart - during the 1780s. Born in Ljubljana, after his first instruction
      in the capital of the Empire, he moved to Milan (around 1792) where he settled definitively. There he was active
      as a teacher and a composer, producing an influential piano method and a consistent number of piano works, vocal
      chamber music and also operas.
      <br />
      The majority of Pollini compositions were published during his Milanese years under his authority and are held at
      the Milan Conservatory Library (I-Mc). Here and in other libraries (like in the Giulio Einaudi Library of
      Correggio, I-CORc or in Giuseppe Greggiati Library of Ostiglia, I-OS) are also preserved many manuscript sources.
      An overview of Pollini’s output entails an assessment of his achievements and permits to locate his personality in
      the context of the professional strategies of a musician in his time: as a pedagogue, composer and performer –
      though he was, because of his family’s activities, not dependent on an income from the musical world. Assessing
      Pollini’s compositional output, life strategies and self-understanding as a musician also permits to investigate
      concepts of nationality in the instrumental music of the period. The early Italian piano school, from the late
      18th century and early 19th century, had a direct filiation from the classical Viennese piano school: in this
      context, Pollini represents the most ideal bridge between these two traditions.
